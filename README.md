This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server using npm run dev.

Now application started to run and we can start editing code as per our requirements.
1.Once we have installed from create-next-app, application is loaded and we can see _app.js file which is a base for our APP. Now we have to update app by adding server.js file where our app is ready to prepare.
2.Then for styles we have to configure it in a config file, if not means we cant add styles for our components.
3.For redux we have to install all react-redux packages, and we have to create store.
4.Once store is ready we can start adding new components like main index, CSS, API, Actions, Reducer, Selector, index
5.The main setup is all about routes. We can add a seperate file called routes and we can add possible routes which are necessary for routing

Now setup is ready and we can call API's based on routes
